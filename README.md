# Keywords Table

This project allows you to display a table of Keywords, paginate through them, sort them ascending and descending by one of the header values and also check the trending keywords.

The data is being served by a fake JSON Server, which is running in port 3004, and the data that comes from those can be changed in `server/keywords.json`.

## Getting Started

To run the app, it's recommended to:

- run a fake JSON server (in src directory) that will run in port 3004.

> npm run server

- run the application in another port.

> npm run start

- To run the existing unit tests:

> npm run test
